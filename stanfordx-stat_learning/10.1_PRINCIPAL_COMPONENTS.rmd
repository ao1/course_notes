### Principal Components

* means are different from variances 
* principal components method deals only with variances
* Assault variance is high, will eat up the first principal component
* variances are different because of different units in all the variables


```{r}
names(USArrests)
apply(USArrests,2,mean)
apply(USArrests,2,var)
```

* perform pca
* standardize the variables
* plot the first two principal components ( loadings and principal component scores in one plot )
* states with high crime go to the left, low crime to the right
* arrows point which states haw which types of crimes

```{r}
pca.out = prcomp(USArrests,scale=T)
pca.out
names(pca.out)
biplot(pca.out,scale=0,cex=0.6)
```
